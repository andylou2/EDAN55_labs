Graphs and Tree-Decompositions for Treewidth
============================================

The graphs are extracted from the graph generators in SageMath [1].
The decompositions are mainly found by running the solver of Tamaki (Meiji University, Japan) [2].
This is the solver that won the first Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments
Challenge [3].

Graph formats
=============

Format .gr
----------
We describe the file format .gr, which is similar to the format used by DIMACS challenges.
This is the file format that a submission to tw-exact or tw-heuristic receives on its
standard input, that a submission to tw-generate must write to its standard output,
and that a submission to tw-instances must use.

Lines are separated by the character ‘\n’. Each line that starts with the character c is
considered to be a comment line. The first non-comment line must be a line starting with p followed
by the problem descriptor tw and the number of vertices n and edges m (separated by a single space
each time). No other line may start with p. Every other line indicates an edge, and must consist of
two decimal integers from 1 to n separated by a space; moreover, graphs are considered undirected
(though they may contain isolated vertices, multiple edges, and loops). For example, a path with
four edges can be defined as follows:

    c This file describes a path with five vertices and four edges.
    p tw 5 4
    1 2
    2 3
    c we are half-way done with the instance definition.
    3 4
    4 5


Format .td
----------

Recall the definition of a tree decomposition of a graph G: It is a tree T such that every vertex x
in V(T) has an associated bag (sometimes called 'piece') B(x) that is a subset of V(G). Every edge
e in E(G) must be a subset of at least one bag B(x). Moreover, for every vertex v in V(G),
the set of tree vertices whose bags contain v induce a connected subtree of T.
The width of T is the maximum size of its bags minus one.
The goal is to compute a tree decomposition of minimum width.

We define the file format .td. As above, c lines are comments and can occur throughout the file.
Instead of a p-line, we now expect a unique solution line s as the first non-comment line,
which contains the string td, followed by the number N of bags of the tree decomposition,
the width of the tree decomposition plus one (i.e., the largest bag size),
as well as the number of vertices of the original input graph.
The next non-comment lines we expect start with b and specify the contents of each bag; for example,
b 4 3 4 6 7 specifies that bag number 4 contains the vertices 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the original graph.
Bags may be empty. For every bag i, there must be exactly one line starting with b i.
All remaining non-comment lines indicate an edge in the tree decomposition,
so it must consist of two decimal integers from 1 and N where the first integer is smaller than the
second, and the graph described this way must be a tree. For example, the following is a suboptimal
tree decomposition of the path with four edges.

    c This file describes a tree decomposition with 4 bags, width 2, for a graph with 5 vertices
    s td 4 3 5
    b 1 1 2 3
    b 2 2 3 4
    b 3 3 4 5
    b 4
    1 2
    2 3
    2 4
 

A useful decomposition for experimenting is described in Eppstein.gr and Eppstein.tr.
This is the graph used in the Wikipedia article for treewidth [4].
